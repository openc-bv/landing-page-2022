	<h2>Efficient symphony</h2>
	<p>In operations and IT, every aspect of the insurance value streams come together as a large collection of interdependent activities. Such as underwriting policies, advice, valuation and (actuarial) pricing, inspections, underwriting activities, client support, and claims, data and information processing, risk, compliance, HR and legal affairs. To organise all insurance activities, risk, compliance and IT as a seamlessly integrated and efficient symphony, requires continuous improvement of the right mix of fully automated activities on the one hand and human interference on the other.</p>
