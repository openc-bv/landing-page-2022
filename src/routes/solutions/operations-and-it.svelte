	<!--<h2>Situation</h2>-->
	<p>In operations and IT, every aspect of the insurance value streams come together as a large collection of interdependent activities. Such as underwriting policy, advice, valuation and (actuarial) pricing, inspections, underwriting, client support and claims management in the form of activities, functions, data, information processing, risk, compliance, HR and legal affairs.</p>

	<!--<h2>Complication</h2>-->
	<p>To organise all insurance activities, risk, compliance and IT as a seamlessly integrated and efficient symphony, requires continuous improvement of the right mix of fully automated activities on the one hand and human interference on the other.</p>

	<!--<h2>Solution</h2>-->
	<p>We act as a trusted partner to insurance and reinsurance companies and the insurance markets. We love insurance operations! We make sure risk, compliance and data security are an integrated part of our approach. We take an integrated approach to the operations and IT of insurance. We even build our own multilingual, multi currency IT platforms that cater for client, insurance partners, product and portfolio management, compliance, data security, and reporting.</p>
